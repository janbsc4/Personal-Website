<p>The funny thing is, all of these behaviours and tools reinforce each other. If you are good at keeping your social media use in control, then it will be easier for you to be concentrated. If it’s easier for you to stay concentrated, you will probably find meditation easier. If you are meditating regularly you will probably be more mindful and thus be better at completing your your daily questions. In incorporating one of these tools into your life you are increasing your odds at succeeding in incorporating the next one. If you’ve adopted some of these, you will also notice that reading, which requires sustained attention, also becomes much easier. Maybe you have a book in mind you’ve always wanted to read. In any case, reading has, in itself a lot of benefits. It might eve reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s or dementia according to new <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/reading-alzheimers-bay/">studies</a>. Books can also be a great source of self-improvement and as <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/marginalia-the-anti-library-and-other-ways-to-master-the-lost-art-of-reading/">Ryan Holiday puts it</a>: </p>

<p>(…) Whatever you’re working on right now, whatever problem you’re struggling with, is probably addressed in some book somewhere written by someone a lot smarter than you.</p>

<p>You might think that, for example after a hard day at work, you don’t want to read because you need to rest. This is a false dichotomy, however. Resting and reading aren’t mutually exclusive. What is draining is gathering the willpower to start reading. It’s helpful, then, to set aside a set time for reading. And so, if you’re reading about something unrelated to work, you will notice that it might even be more refreshing than brainless vegging around. </p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start, here two suggestions:</p>
<p><b>Triggers - Marshall Goldsmith</b> This book is where the idea of the active questions comes from. Marshall Goldsmith is a very experienced CEO coach and definitely knows what he is talking about. The book is packed with concise advice and doesn’t beat around the bush. Short but very valuable.</p>
<p><b>Deep Work - Cal Newport</b> This one is almost a must read. Cal Newport first explains why deep work today is more important than ever and then gives loads of concrete advice on how to do great deep work. There is definitely points in this book that seem very obvious, however, there is a big difference between getting something and doing something about it. This book is great at taking you from getting to doing.</p>
<br>
<p>Bonus: <b>Ego Is The Enemy - Ryan Holiday</b> This book is definitely more on the philosophical side. However, reading this book did wonders for me and my worldview. I would recommend this book event to people that don’t consider themselves to have a big ego.</p>
